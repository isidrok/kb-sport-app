**Completed**: 3-phase service layer refactoring for better separation of concerns and code quality

**Key Achievements**:
- Created shared utilities (coordinate transforms, confidence checks) in `src/utils/`
- Consolidated configuration constants in `src/config/services.config.ts`
- Extracted recording logic into dedicated `RecordingService`
- Moved countdown logic from service layer to UI layer
- Removed all debug console.log statements and unused code
- Established architecture rules for future development

**Results**: 4 new files created, 6 files refactored, improved service architecture with single responsibility principle and proper UI/service separation.
